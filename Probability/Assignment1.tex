                In first day, if he studies 0 hour, he can study 0, 1 ,2 or 3 hours in the  next day.
                \\
                If he studies 1 hour in the first day, he can study 0,1,2 or 3 hours in the next day.
                \\
                If he studies 2 hours in the first day, he can study 0,1 or 2 hours in the next day.
                \\
                If he studies 3 hours in the first day, he can study 0 or 1 hour in the next day.
                \\
                We can use the formula in \textbf{1.1} where $n_1=4$
                $$Total \ number= \sum _{i=1}^{4}n_{2i}=13$$

                The total number of games in a whole basketball play-off $ n\in [m,2m-1]$, for the winner, they should win $m$ games and the last game. For the loser, they will win $n-m$ games and the will lose the last game.
                \\
                Hence, 
                $$Totla\ number=\sum _{i=0} ^{m-1} C_{m+i-1} ^{i}$$

        If we give this three books to three students, each student can get one book,
        $$T_1=P_{12}^3$$
        If we give this three books to two students, one of students can get one book, and another can get two books,
        $$T_2=C_3^1 P_{12}^{2}$$
        If we give this three books to only one student,
        $$T_3=P_{12}^1$$
        Hence,
        $$T=T_1+T_2+T_3=1596$$

        Let $A$ be the event that two cards are both greater than $3$ and less than $8$.
        The card can be $4,5,6$ or $7$, total card is $12$
        $$P(A)= \frac{C_{12} ^ 2}{C_{52} ^ 2}$$
