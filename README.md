## My nOtebOok

In the last sem and before, I majored in mathematics, or more precisely, statistics. So you can see many math assignment in here.

From this semester (20/21 AY Sem B), my major is computer science, and I believe that there will be more code and less math.

Most of them are `.tex` file and its `.pdf` file and there are some `matlab` code because I have a class called Numerical Methods which need matlab to do home.
